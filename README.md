# Instagram Insights Scraper

This repository contains a Python script that logs into Instagram (via [instagrapi](https://github.com/adw0rd/instagrapi)) and collects engagement insights from recent posts. It produces a **single-row CSV summary per account** with metrics such as:

- Average likes and comments  
- View-adjusted engagement rate (for Reels/Video posts)  
- Posting frequency (posts per week)  
- Hashtag efficiency (top-performing hashtags)  
- Best posting windows (by hour and weekday)  
- Caption length vs. engagement correlation  
- Content category lift (simple theme guess from hashtags/captions)  
- Country/region guess (based on bio text)  

---

## Features
- Pulls the last **N posts** per username (default = 25)  
- Uses Instagram private/mobile endpoints for more reliable data access  
- Exports results to CSV with consistent schema (compatible with TikTok schema columns)  
- Prints a per-post snapshot (views, likes, comments, ER, date, caption preview)

Instagram does not expose saves/shares publicly ‚Üí these are always reported as 0.

For photos, ‚Äúviews‚Äù are typically not available, so view-adjusted ER applies mainly to Reels/Video.
